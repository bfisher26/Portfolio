# Projects:
----------------------------
## Emergency Management System
##### Class:
Senior Capstone Project
##### Technologies:
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* MySQL
* Google Maps API

##### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Emergency Management System, EMS, is a web application that allows users to create and store plans for a variety of emergency scenarios. The features provided to users include new users can create an account and login. Users can create locations and create a variety of emergency scenarios on each location. For each scenario users can add checklists and descriptions of what to do in that emergency. The locations are displayed in an interactive Google Map and their information can be accessed by a click of a button. Users can also create emergency groups with other users and share the locations and scenarios they make with them. Finally a supply calculator is available to users to make food and water survival calculations.

###### Learning Goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was the culmination of my Computer Science career here at Westminster and I set out to further develop my problem solving skills and get experience completing a large individual project.

* To    develop    effective    problem    solving    skills
* To    acquire    significant    project    experience    working       individually
* To understand the concepts and techniques of object oriented software design
* To    attain    a    system    level    understanding    of    the    computer

## Chatroom Project
##### Class:
Networks

##### Technologies:
* Python
* GUI

##### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The client-server chat room application includes a server application that listens to a specified port for a client connections to join the chat room. The server keeps track of all client connections in the chat room. A client joins with a username and can begin chatting. Messages will be broadcast to all members of the chatroom.

###### Learning Goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chatroom project gave a unique challenge with new ideas and allowed me to collaborate with my partner and solve problems as a team.  
* To    acquire    significant    project    experience    working   in    a    group    setting

## Web Server Project
##### Class:
Networks
##### Technologies:
* Java
* HTML/CSS

##### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a multithreaded web server that listens to port 8080 and implements the GET command of the HTTP 1.1 protocol.  The web server services each GET request in a separate thread.  The server listens for client requests and when received, the thread created by the server will parse the request, read the file on the server, construct the HTTP headers, and return the headers and contents of the file.

###### Learning Goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The web server taught me about HTTP responses & requests and parsing those responses and requests. This was a significant test of my problem solving skills and a very fulfilling project.  I was able to reach my goal of understanding object oriented software design with Java and developing with sockets.   
* To understand the concepts and techniques of object oriented software design
* To    develop    effective    problem    solving    skills

## Math Sports Project by ByteMe
##### Class:
Software Engineering
##### Technologies:
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* MySQL

##### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  MathSports is a web application built for the purpose of teaching math skills to 1st and 2nd grade students through interactive games with sports themes. The students are able to practice their addition and subtraction skills along with place values questions.  There are two views: one for the teacher and one for the students.  The teacher is able to add students, add/remove questions, and much more.


###### Learning Goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Math Sports was a semester long group project that gave a real world prompt to design a piece of software with specific requirements for a customer.  I learned a lot about project planning, project management, and problem solving.
* To    acquire    significant    project    experience    working   in    a    group    setting
* To    develop    effective    problem    solving    skills

## Elm Invaders Game
### Link: http://laxfish.github.io/
##### Class:
Programming Languages
##### Technologies:
* Elm
* HTML/CSS

##### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Elm Invaders is a online game developed in the Elm language.  Elm is a functional language that compiles to Javascript.  In the game users land as an astronaut on the moon and must survive and capture all the aliens.

###### Learning Goal:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The goals of the Elm Invaders project was to learn a totally new language and my first experience with a functional language.  This was my first introduction as well to web development and proved to be challenge to solve problems I had never faced before.  This is my first game I have ever developed and it is still deployed online today.
* To    develop    effective    problem    solving    skills
